### Hi there, nice to meet you! 👋

I'm Davide Carrara, a PhD student in Mathematical Models and Methods for Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. Before that, I got a MSc in Mathematical Engineering at PoliMi and I was a Machine Learning intern at Bang & Olufsen A/S. My studies are currently focused on Machine Learning, Data Science and whatever lies within.
